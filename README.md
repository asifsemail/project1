# Simran Files for Team 1 Project Spenderlytics

I worked on defining the highest Life Time Value (LTV) credit card users and creating future projections. An LTV score was calculated for each cc number and the top 25% were used as the highest LTV cc users to forecast. Both a Prophet and ARIMA model were used to perform the projection. Findings show the total spend is forecasted to decline over the next year. The beginings of a UI app is also created to demonstrate how a possible software package could look like. The files with title importdatafile, inputscreen, mainscreen, mycalcs, mypart, pdpfgenerator, and the two logo icons are part of the deliverable package. The inputscreen.py is the file that is run first that uses all the other files to present the user with the analysis graphs. There is also a button to generate a pdf with all the graphs in it.
